# Predicting how Microsoft can launch into the movie business 
## a. Business understanding
Microsoft is a company that is well known for making great software prducts which are wired towards the windows operating systems and most of the software that is in line with that. Microsoft is a company that was formed in 1975. Its main objective is to ensure that its customers are comfortable when working, playing or communicate while interacting with the product. Microsoft has offices in more than 100 countries.

Microsoft mainly gains its profits from developing, licensing many products and services in conjuction with selling hardware and software which is one of their major strongholds. Microsoft also has products such as personal computers, servers, mobile phones. They also deal with hardware such as Xbox gaming and entertainment console, Xbox 360 accessories and other hardware products. They also provide consultation, product and support services and all kind of cloud based solutions. 

Movie making is a craft which most companies are leveraging based on the fact that most companies are gaining through it. This is whereby most companies take their time to come up with, create files and videos which are are attached together to come up with excellent movies altogether. 

Microsoft having witnessed how this has helped other companies, its therefore looking for ways in which they can also leverage on that to ensure that they also achieve from that.Microsoft wants to venture into the movie making business. Microsoft being a technological company, this has proved to be  a weighty matter since thy have not handled such kind of a business before. 

The project involves use of data to help Microsoft have the knowhow of making a movie, what is involved in the process  and know which movies are doing best right know so that they will most likely invest in that to capitalize in making much profits. 

## b. Problem Statement
Movie making is an interesting art which most companies enjoy to do. The art has caused some companies to make way much profits than other in the previous years. Microsoft therefore is looking at ways in which they can do this and be better at it.
In that spirit, I have decided to use a few instuments in my learning curve to ensure that Microsoft can make better decisions in this journey.

## c. Main Objective
To develop a model that Microsoft can use as they begin their videos company and achieve consistent growth as they do so.

## d. Specific Objectives
. Develop and test machine learning models that showcases what criteria will be used to achieve good profits in this venture
. Evaluate the previous companies and how they have made profits in order to check if the same or an altered strategy can work for us
 
 ## e. Experimental Design
 1. Data collection
 2. Read and check data
 3. Cleaning the data
 4. Exploratory Data Analysis
 5. Data modelling and model performance evaluation
 6. Use the model to make predictions
 7. Conclusions
 8. Deploy the model
